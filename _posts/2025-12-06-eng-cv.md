# ABOUT ME
I am a third-year student in the German-taught Management Information
Systems program at Marmara University, where I also serve as the president
of the Marmara University Cybersecurity Club. My current focus is on
improving my skills in networking, Linux, and especially offensive security. I
have foundational experience with core networking concepts and
configurations.
My primary interest lies in offensive security, particularly in web application
and infrastructure security. I actively work on identifying vulnerabilities and
developing strategies to exploit and secure these systems. Additionally, I
have a strong interest in OT security, focusing on the protection of SCADA
systems and the identification of threats targeting industrial control
environments.
I am continuously developing my offensive security expertise to help

organizations identify and mitigate security risks before they can be
exploited by malicious actors.
